# Part 1 Dockerize

## CI Project Overview

The intent of this project is to step away from AWS for a brief second in order to learn how to use Docker. 
This tool provides another way to spin up builds quickly and efficiently. Docker allows you to build up images
define setup and then save that image for yourself and others to use. They an layer their own builds on top of 
your image and expand it out for their purposes. Docker containers are nice since they do not use the same process
as Virtual Instance machines that allocate CPU and RAM specifically for that instance.
